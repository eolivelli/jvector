/**
 * Provides utilities for characterizing the underlying storage hardware and layout.
 * <p>
 * This package contains logic to detect and classify storage tiers (e.g., Local SSD,
 * Persistent Disk, Network Filesystem) across different environments including
 * AWS, GCP, and local development machines.
 * <p>
 * The primary entry point is {@link io.github.jbellis.jvector.example.util.storage.CloudStorageLayoutUtil},
 * which provides a unified view of the system's mount points and their corresponding
 * {@link io.github.jbellis.jvector.example.util.storage.CloudStorageLayoutUtil.StorageClass}.
